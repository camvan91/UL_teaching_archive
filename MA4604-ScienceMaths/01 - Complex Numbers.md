## Complex Numbers

de Moivre's formula can easily be derived from Euler's formula

$$ {\displaystyle e^{ix}=\cos x+i\sin x}$$
and the exponential law for integer powers

$$ {\displaystyle \left(e^{ix}\right)^{n}=e^{inx}.}$$
Then, by Euler's formula,

$$ {\displaystyle e^{inx}=\cos nx+i\sin nx.}$$


#### Roots of Complex Numbers
A modest extension of the version of de Moivre's formula can be used to find 
the nth roots of a complex number (equivalently, the power of 1/n).

If z is a complex number, written in polar form as

$$ {\displaystyle z=r\left(\cos x+i\sin x\right),}$$
then the $n-$th roots of $z$ are given by

$$ {\displaystyle r^{\frac {1}{n}} \;=\; \left(\cos {\frac {x+2\pi k}{n}}+i\sin {\frac {x+2\pi k}{n}}\right)}$$
where k varies over the integer values from 0 to n âˆ’ 1.

*This formula is also sometimes known as de Moivre's formula.*
