\sqrt{3} + i in form (a+ib)

\[r = sqrt{a^2+b^2} \therefore r = \sqrt{(3)+(1^2)} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \] 

$$ \theta = tan^{-1}(b/a) $$




\[ \frac{dy}{dx} - \frac{2y}{x} =2x^3 \]

\[ \frac{dy}{dx} - \left(\frac{2}{x}\right)y =2x^3 \]

\[ \frac{dy}{dx} - q(X)y = p(x) \]




$$ z = x^2e^y = xy^3$$

\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = e^y \frac{\partial (x^2)}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial (x^2)}{\partial x}


\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = x^2 \frac{\partial (x^2)}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial (x^2)}{\partial y}

## First Order Differential Equations


 * Integration Factor $\mu$
 * Homogeneous Equations (Using inital conditions)

Example 
\[ y^{\prime \prime } + 6 y^{ \prime }  + 8y = 0 \]


First-order, separable in x and y[21]
{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}P(y){\frac {dy}{dx}}+Q(x)&=0\\P(y)\,dy+Q(x)\,dx&=0\end{aligned}}} {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}P(y){\frac {dy}{dx}}+Q(x)&=0\\P(y)\,dy+Q(x)\,dx&=0\end{aligned}}}

Integrate throughout.	{\displaystyle \int ^{y}P(\lambda )\,{d\lambda }+\int ^{x}Q(\lambda )\,d\lambda =C\,\!}


## Second Order Differential Equations

Here we will study ordinary differential equations of the standard
form below, known as the second order linear equations:
$$y^{\prime \prime} + p(t) y^{\prime \prime} + q(t) y = g(t).$$
Homogeneous Equations: If g(t) = 0, then the equation above becomes
$$ y^{\prime \prime} + p(t) y^{\prime \prime} + q(t) y = 0.$$

It is called a homogeneous equation. Otherwise, the equation is
nonhomogeneous (or inhomogeneous). 

Any function of the form
 $$ y = C1 e^t + C2 e^{âˆ’t} $$

will satisfy the equation. In fact, this is the ***general solution*** of the
above differential equation.
