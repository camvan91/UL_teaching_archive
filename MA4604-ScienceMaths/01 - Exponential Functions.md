## Exponential functions



* In a lot of cases these function are related to time periods. So we will call the
function $f(t)$.
    
* It is important to remember the rules of exponentials (and logarithms too)
    
* Remember $e$ is a constant, and should just be treated like another number.    
    
$$ f(t) = e^{t} $$
