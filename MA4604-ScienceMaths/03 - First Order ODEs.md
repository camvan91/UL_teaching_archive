## First Order Seperable Differential Equations

* Check that the equation can be seperated into the following form. 
* Use simple algebra to re-arrange equation

$$ g(y) dy = f(x) dx $$


* Here $f(x)$ and $g(y)$ are simple expressions in terms of $x$ and $y$ respectively.
* If you can, just integrate both sides to solve.
* Remember to include the coefficient of differentiation.
