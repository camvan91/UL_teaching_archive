The probabilities  $P(X_i)$ must satisfy two conditions
\begin{itemize}

\item The probability must be between 0 and 1.
\[ 0 \leq P(X_i) \leq 1 \]

\item
\[ \sum P(X_i) = 1\]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example}
A sales manager needs to decide on the stock level of a weekly magazine. The Demand level is
unpredictable but information on the distribution of D can be got from data on the number of sales requests for previous weeks.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|cccccc|ccccc|}
No. of Requests & 20 & 21 & 22 & 23 & 24 & 25 & 26 & 27 & 28 & 29 \\ 
Probability & 0.03 & 0.05 & 0.06 & 0.10 & 0.18 & 0.20 & 0.15 & 0.06 &  & 0.04 \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Distribution of Discrete Random Variables

Bernouilli distribution, for each trial there are two possible outcomes. Each Trial is identical to all the others
with a constant probability of success e.g. tossing a coin. the two outcomes are heads or tails and the probability of success is 0.5.

Binomial Distribution : fixed number $n$ of independent trials, only two possible outcomes for each trial i.e. success and failure, constant probability $p$ of success at each trial.
the variable is the number of successes in $n$ trials.
