Hypothesis Testing for Two Groups

Paired Data : every individual in one of the groups has a unique match of pair in the other group.

Normality Assumptions; for paired data, the difference between the paired observations should be normally distributed.

This assumption can be checked by looking at the shape of the frequency distribution.

\subsection{Example for Paired Data}

A firm is trying to decide between two delivery services that promise next-day deliveries to district offices.

In testing the delivery times, for the two services, the firm sends two reports to each of the 10 offices with one report being carried by one delivery service and the other carried by the second.

Do the data below indicate a difference in mean delivery times.
