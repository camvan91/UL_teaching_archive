Example

A bank manager wants to encourage her customers to pay regular bills by direct debit. A random sample of 20 customers shows a mean of 19 monthly direct
debits with a vairance of 6.

In another branch, a sample of 15 customers showed a mean of 16, with a variance of 22.

Is there significant difference between the two means.

\item[Control Group] $\hat{p}_2$ = 11/35

\subsection{Confidence Intervla for the Difference of two proportions}


\[ \pm 1.96 \sqrt{  \frac{(\hat{p}_1) \times (1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \frac{(\hat{p}_1) \times (1 - \hat{p}_2) }{n_2} } \]
\[\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2 = 0.76 - 0.31 - 0.45\]

\[S.E, (\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) = \sqrt{  \frac{(0.76) \times (0.24)}{34} + \frac{(0.31) \times (0.69) }{35} } = 0.107\]
