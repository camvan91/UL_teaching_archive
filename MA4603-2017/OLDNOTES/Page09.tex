\section*{Sampling Distributions}

A sampling statistic from a SRS has a predictable patter of values in repeated samples. This pattern is called a sampling distribution.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------%
Example: A simple random sample (SRS) of 30 managers was taken to find out how many had completed the company's internal
training course.The proporrtion who had done the course was 0.7 (i.e. 70\%).
Take another sample of 30 managers. Find the proportion for that sample.
Repeat this for 500 samples each for 30 managers and plot the 500 values of the proportion.

The figure below the displays the results. It wshows what values the statistic takes in many samples and how
often it takes each values (i.e. the sampling distribution of the test statistic)

\subsection*{Notes on Sampling}

\begin{itemize}

\item Values of statistics from an SRS have a known distribution in repeated sampling.

\item When the sampling frame list the entore population, simple random sampling produces unbiased estimates

\item The precision of a statistic from an SRS depends on the size of the sample

\end{itemize}

%------------------------------------------------------------%

A sample statistic is unbiased if, on average over many samples, the statistic is a correct estimate of the population parameter of intersest.
