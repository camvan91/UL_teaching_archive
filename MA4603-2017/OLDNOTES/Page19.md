Numerical Descriptive Measures
1) Measures of Centrality
2) Measures of Variability

Both types of measurement are used to create a concise numerical summary of the data.

Measures of Centrality

there are three main measures of centrality : mean, median and mode.



\subsection*{Mathemathical Notation}


\[ \bar{x} = \frac{}{n}\]

%-------------------------------%

\begin{itemize}
\item $\bar{x}$ is the the sample mean. 
\item $\mu$ is the populaiton mean
\item Often we take the sample mean as an estimate for the population mean $\mu$
\end{itemize}

\[ \mu = \frac{}{N} \]
