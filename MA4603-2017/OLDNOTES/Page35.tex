As the diagram below shows, any position along a horizontal axis can be expressed as a distance of a number of standard deviations (negaive or positive) from the mean.

The distance is known as the standard normal deviate. It is equivalent to looking at a Normal Distribution with a mean of ) and a Standard deviation of 1.
