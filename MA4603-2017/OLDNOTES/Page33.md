4.1 the Normal Distribution

The above diagram shows a frequency distribution of height. 

The observed frequencies have been approximated by a smooth curve which is 
the probability denity of a normal distribution.

The normal distribution is defined by two quantities, the mean $\mu$ and its standard deviation $\sigma$

Changing $\mu$ shifts the curve to the left of the right.

Increasing $\sigma$ makes the whole curve flatter or more spread out.
