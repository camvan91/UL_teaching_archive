Small and independent Samples

When sample size are small, we will use a methodology based on the assumption that we have two normally distributed
populations with equal variance. The assumption must be tested before any hypothesis test can be carried out.

\subsection{Example}

12 Test Cars were compared with 8 cars currently on the market in terms of handling comfort and miles per gallon petrol.
Use the data below to estimate the difference between the mean miles per gallon for the two types of cars.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
Sample & Test Cars $ Market Cars \\ \hline
Size & n_1 = 12 $ n_2 = 8 \\ \hline 
Mean & \bar{x}_1 = 29.8 & \bar{x}_1 = 27.3 \\ \hline
SD & s_1 = 2.56 & s_2 = 1.81 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
