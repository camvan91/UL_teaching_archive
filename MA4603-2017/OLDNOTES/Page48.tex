General Method for hypothesis test:

Set up the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis

Decide whether a one-tailed test or a two tailed test is appropriate.

Decide on a significance level $\alpha$

Determine the appropriate critical values.

Take a random sample

Calculate the value of the test statistic and compare it with the critical value(s).

If the value of the test statistic falls in the rejection region, reject the null hypothesis. otherwise we fail to reject the null hypothesis

State the conclusion in words


%-----------------------------------------------%

\begin{itemize}

\item[p >0.05] No evidence against $h_0$ in favour of $h_a$

\item[p <0.05] evidence against $h_0$ in favour of $h_a$

\item[p <0.01]

\item[p <0.001]

\end{itemize}

The term statistically significant usually mean the p-value is less than 0.05.
Most statistical software packages print the $p-$value associated with an hypothesis test.

The use can then draw a conclusion without referring to statistical tables
