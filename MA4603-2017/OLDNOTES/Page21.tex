Comparing measures of centrality

Advantages and Disadvantages

Examples

\[1.8,2.7,3.5,4.6,5.4\]
Mean - 3.6
Median - =?



Examples
Change 5.4 to 54

\[1.8,2.7,3.5,4.6,54\]
Mean - ?
Median - = 3.5

\subsection*{Range}

Range = Maximum - Minimum
It conveys the least information. it is computed only from the extreme values so it provides no indication about the spread of the data.

It is easy to compute, using only two numbers.

It is sensitive to extreme values


%=============================% 
Example 3,4,5,6

\[\sum x_i = 3+4+5+6 = 18\]


\[(\sum x_i) = (18)^2\]


\[\sum (x_i^2) = 3^2+4^2+5^2+6^2 = 86\]
