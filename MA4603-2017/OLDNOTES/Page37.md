Central Limit Theorem

What if the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is unknown.

Use the best possible estimate of $\sigma$ which is $s$, the sample standard deviaiton.


%--------------------------------%


\[  192 \pm 1.96 (9/12)  = 192 \pm 1.47 = [190.53,193.47] \]

There is a 95% chance that the true population mean lies in the range 190.53cm to 193.47cm.

What is the best possible estimate of $\mu$.

\subsection{Example}

A random sample of 100 third year was taken to estimate the average of all third years.

The sample mean is 21 and the sample standard deviation is 1.

Give a 95\% confideence interval for the average age of all third years. Give a 99% confidence interval for the average age of all 
third years.
