Additionally, every normal curve (regardless of its mean or standard deviation) conforms to the following "rule".

\begin{itemize}
\item About $68\%$ of the area under the curve falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean.
\item About $95\%$ of the area under the curve falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean.
\item About $99.7\%$ of the area under the curve falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean.
\end{itemize}

Collectively, these points are known as the empirical rule or the 68-95-99.7 rule. Clearly, given a normal distribution, most outcomes will be within 3 standard deviations of the mean.
