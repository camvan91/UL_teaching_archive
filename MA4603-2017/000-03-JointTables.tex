A joint probability table is a table in which all possible events (or outcomes) for one variable are listed as
row headings, all possible events for a second variable are listed as column headings, and the value entered in
each cell of the table is the probability of each joint occurrence. 
\\
\\
\noindent Often, the probabilities in such a table are based
on observed frequencies of occurrence for the various joint events. The table
of joint-occurrence frequencies which can serve as the basis for constructing a joint probability table is called a
contingency table.
