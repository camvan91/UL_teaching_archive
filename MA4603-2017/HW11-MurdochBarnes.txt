Using the Murdoch Barnes Tables

\section{The Standard Normal (``Z‚Äù) Distribution}
 
A random variable that has a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one is said to have a standard normal probability distribution.  It is often nick-named the "z" distribution.
 
Importantly, probabilities relating to the z distribution are comprehensively tabulated in Murdoch Barnes table 3.

Given a value of k (with k between 0 and 4), the probability of a  standard normal "z" random variable being greater than (or equal to) k is given in Murdoch Barnes table 3 (page 71). 

 

\subsubsection{Example 1 }

Find  $P(Z \geq 1.80)$

note  1.80 = 1.8 + 0.00

    The row is 1.8
    The column is 0.00


	& 0.00	& 0.01	& 0.02	& 0.03	& ....  \\ \hline
....	&	&	& 	&	& 	\\ \hline
1.7	& 0.0446& 	& 	& ....	&	\\ \hline
1.8	& 0.0359& 0.0351& 	& ....	&	\\ \hline
1.9	& 0.0287&	&	& ....	&	\\ \hline
....	&	&	&	&	&	\\ \hline

Answer  $P(Z geq 1.80 = 0.0359)$





\subsubsection{Example 2}  

Find  $P(Z geq 1.96)$

note  1.96 = 1.9 + 0.06

    The row is 1.9
    The column is 0.06

	&....	&0.05	&0.06	&0.07	&.... \\ \hline
....	&	&	&	&	&     \\ \hline
1.8	&	&	&0.0314	&	&     \\ \hline
1.9	&	&0.0256	&0.0250	&0.0244	&     \\ \hline
2.0	&	&	&....	&	&    \\ \hline	
....	&	&	&	&	&	\\ \hline

Answer $P(Z geq 1.96)  = 0.0250$
