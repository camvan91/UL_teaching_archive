(c) The sales of a product are normally distributed with a mean of 200 units per week and a standard deviation of 40 units per week.

\begin{itemize}

\item[(ii)] What is the probability that between 220 and 260 units will be sold in any given week?

\item[(iii)] To have a 98\% probability that the company will have sufficient stock to cover the weekly demand, how many units should be produced?

\item[(iv)] Use a control chart to identify which of the following weekly sales figures (in units) were unusually high or unusually low: 280, 330, 50, 310, 285, 65.
