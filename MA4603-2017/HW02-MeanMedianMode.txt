\subsection{Numerical Methods}
The only way of describing qualitative data is using graphical methods. 
The first step in describing quantitative data is using graphical methods i.e. get a picture of your data. 

Since quantitative data are numeric, however, we can also use numeric methods i.e. calculate a set of numbers that convey a good mental picture of the frequency distribution. 

There are two main numerical descriptive measures :

\begin{enumerate}
\item Measure of centrality i.e. measure of the centre of the distribution
\item Measure of dispersion i.e. the spread, dispersion of the data
\end{enumerate}
When we know the middle of our distribution and how spread out it is about the middle, we have two numbers which create a concise numerical summary of the data. 

The measure of centrality and dispersion we use depends on what our data looks like i.e. the shape of the distribution.

%------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{Percentiles}
A percentile is defined as a point below which a certain per cent of the observations lie e.g. the 50th percentile is the point below which half the observations lie. The percentiles that divide the data into four quarters are called: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[Q1] - 25th percentile or lower quartile
\item[Q2] - 50th percentile or median
\item[Q3] - 75th percentile or upper quartile
\end{itemize}

A measure of variability i.e. how the spread out the data are  is the difference between the point below which 25% of your data lie and the point below which 75% of your data lie i.e. Q3  - Q1. This is called the Interquartile Range  and it is commonly used for skewed data.
A graphical representation of the quartiles is called a Box plot 
% (Figure 1.3). 

It displays 
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] lower quartile 
\item[(b)] median 
\item[(c)] upper quartile  
\item[(d)] interquartile range (IQR)  
\item[(e)] whiskers of length = 1.5 IQR   
\item[(f)] outlying observations
\end{itemize}

%=================================================%
%% MEASURES OF CENTRALITY

\noindent \textbf{Median}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The other commonly used measure of centrality is the median.
	
	\item The median is the value halfway through the ordered data set, below and above which there lies an equal number of data values.
	\item For an odd sized data set, the median is the middle element of the \textbf{ordered} data set.
	\item For an even sized data set, the median is the average of the middle pair of elements of an \textbf{ordered} data set.
	\item It is generally a good descriptive measure of the location which works well for \textbf{\emph{skewed data}}, or data with \textbf{\emph{outliers}}.
	
	\item For later, the median is the 0.5 quantile, and the second quartile $Q_2$.
\end{itemize}


\noindent \textbf{Computing the median}
\textbf{Example:}


With an odd number of data values, for example nine, we have:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Data : $\{96, 48, 27, 72, 39, 70, 7, 68, 99 \}$
	\item Ordered Data :  $\{7, 27, 39, 48, 68, 70, 72, 96, 99\}$
	\item Median : 68, leaving four values below and four values above
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
With an even number of data values, for example 8, we have:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Data : $\{96, 48 ,27 ,72, 39, 70, 7, 68  \}$
	\item Ordered Data : $\{7, 27, 39, 48, 68, 70, 72, 96\}$
	\item Median : Halfway between the two 'middle' data points - in this case halfway between 48 and 68, and so the median is 58
\end{itemize}

	\noindent \textbf{Using \texttt{R} to compute mean (and median)}
	When implementing this in R, we would use the following code
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	> x1=c(96, 48, 27, 72, 39, 70, 7, 68, 99 )
	> sort(x1)
	[1]  7 27 39 48 68 70 72 96 99
	> median(x1)
	[1] 68
	>
	> x2=c(96, 48 ,27 ,72, 39, 70, 7, 68)
	> sort(x2)
	[1]  7 27 39 48 68 70 72 96
	> median(x2)
	[1] 58
	\end{verbatim}
	

%--------------------------------------------------------%


\subsection{Arithmetic Mean}
The arithmetic mean is what is commonly called the average: When the word "mean" is used without a modifier, it can be assumed that it refers to the arithmetic mean. The mean is the sum of all the scores divided by the number of scores. The formula in summation notation is:

\[\mu = \sum X/N\]

where $\mu$ is the population mean and N is the number of scores. 

If the scores are from a sample, then the symbol M refers to the mean and N refers to the sample size. The formula for M is the same as the formula for
μ. 

\[\mu = \sum X/N\]

The mean is a good measure of central tendency for roughly symmetric distributions but can be misleading in skewed distributions since it can be greatly influenced by scores in the tail. Therefore, other statistics such as the median may be more informative for distributions such as reaction time or family income that are frequently very skewed.


\begin{itemize}
	
\item The \textbf{Mean} or average is probably the most commonly used method of describing central 
tendency. To compute the mean all you do is add up all the values and divide by the number of values.
	
	For example, the mean or average quiz score is determined by summing all the scores and dividing by the number of students taking the exam. For example, consider the test score values:
	
	\[15, 20, 21, 20, 36, 15, 25, 15\]
	
	The sum of these 8 values is 167, so the mean is $167/8 = 20.875$.
	
	\item The \textbf{Median} is the score found at the exact middle of the set of values. One way to compute the median is to list all scores in numerical order, and then locate the score in the center of the sample. For example, if there are 500 scores in the list, score no. 250 would be the median. If we order the 8 scores shown above, we would get:
	
	\[15,15,15,20,20,21,25,36\]
	
	There are 8 scores and score no. 4 and no. 5 represent the halfway point. Since both of these scores are 20, the median is 20. If the two middle scores had different values, you would have to interpolate to determine the median.
	
	
\item The \textbf{mode} is the most frequently occurring value in the set of scores. 
To determine the mode, you might again order the scores as shown above, and then count each one. 
The most frequently occurring value is the mode. In our example, the value 15 occurs three times 
and is the model. In some distributions there is more than one modal value. For instance, in a 
bimodal distribution there are two values that occur most frequently.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Introduction to Statistics}

	\textbf{Population mean}
	
	
When population has a finite quantity N, the population mean can be calculated as follows,
	
	=xiNfori = 1.....N.
	

	
	\noindent \textbf{Introduction to Statistics}
The Median
	
The Median is denoted as x.
	
It can also be consider as the second quartile Q3

\section{Medians and modes}
The median ($\tilde{x}$) is the value that separates a sample into two groups; 50\% of observations are greater
than the median and 50\% are less than it.
\\ \\\noindent The set of n numbers is arranged in ascending order, say as $x_(1), x_(2), x_(3), \dots x_(n)$, where $x_(1)$ is the smallest of the observations and $x_(n)$ is the largest.
\\ \\\noindent Computation of the median differs for samples that have an odd number size, and samples with an even number size. If sample size $n$ is odd
\[ \tilde{x} =  x_{(\frac{n+1}{2})} ,\]
or if $n$ is even 
\[ \tilde{x} =  \frac{  x_{(\frac{n}{2})}  + x_{(\frac{n+1}{2})} }{2}. \]
\\ \\ \noindent A visual inspection of the ordered data set will be useful for a quick determination of the median.
For example, the median of the numbers 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7 is 4 (check this by
rearranging the numbers in order!) and for 1, 3, 4 and 5, the median is (3+4)/2, that is
3.5.
\\ \\ \noindent The mode is the most frequently occurring value. There is not necessarily only one
such value. For example, the figures 1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 9, 9, 11 have two modes: the
numbers 2 and 9.



\section{Arithmetic mean} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item One of the basic quantities is the arithmetic mean (it is sometimes
	called the `average but there are in fact other measures of average apart from the
	mean ). 
	\item The arithmetic mean is calculated by
	adding the measures of the number of observations in which you are interested and
	dividing by the number of observations.
\end{itemize}

\[ \bar{x} =  \frac{\sum x}{n}  \]

\noindent For our data set $\bar{x} = \frac{22}{5}  = \textbf{4.4}$.


\subsection{The Arithmetic Mean (average)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose we have a data set $X$ comprised of the following values
	\[X = \{4,6,12,8,15,19,11, 13\}\]
\item To compute $\bar{x}$, the \textbf{arithmetic mean} of X, we add up all the elements of $X$ and divide by the number of elements in $X$ (i.e. the sample size $n$).

\[ \bar{x} = \frac{4+6+12+8+15+19+11+13}{8} =\frac{88}{8} = 11\] 
\item We would verbalize $\bar{x}$ as ``x-bar".
\end{itemize}
%------------------------------------%
\subsection*{The Median}
\begin{itemize}
\item To compute the \textbf{Median} of $X$ (usually denoted $\tilde{X}$ or $Q_2$), we must first check if there are even or odd elements in the data set. 
\item Then we have to reorder our data set, into \textbf{\textit{ascending}} order.
\[  X = \{4, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 19\}\]
\item The median can then be calculated as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\ast$] the middle value of the ordered data set, when there is an odd number of elements.
\item[$\ast$] the mean of the middle pair of values of the ordered data set, when there is an even number of elements.
\end{itemize}
\item For the sample data set $X$ that we have seen previously, there are an even number of values in this data set (recall $n=8$). \\ \smallskip The median is therefore the average of the middle pair of values.
\[ \tilde{x} = \frac{11+12}{2} = \frac{23}{2} = 11.5 \]

\medskip
\item Let us add a new value 15 to the data set.
	\[X_2 = \{4,6,12,8,15,19,11, 13,15\}\]
\item There are 4 elements to the left, and 4 elements to the right.
\end{itemize}
\section{Summation}
The summation sign $\sum$ is commonly used in most areas of statistics.
Given $x_1 = 3, x_2= 1, x_3 = 4, x_4 = 6, x_5= 8 $ find:

\[
(i) \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{i=n} x_{i}  \hspace{3cm}
(ii) \displaystyle\sum_{i=3}^{i=4} x_{i}^2
\]
\begin{eqnarray*}(i) \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{i=n} x_{i} &=& x_1 + x_2 +  x_3 +  x_4 + x_5 \\  &=& 3 +1 +4 +6 + 8 \\ &=& \textbf{22} \end{eqnarray*}

\[ (ii) \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{i=n} x_{i}^2 = x_3^2 + x_4^2  = 9 + 16 = \textbf{25} \]

\noindent When all elements of a data set are used, a simple version of the summation notation can be used.
$\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{i=n} x_{i}$  can simply be written as $\sum x$


\subsection*{Example}
Given that $p_1= 1/4, p_2= 1/8, p_3= 1/8,p_4= 1/3, p_5 = 1/6$ find:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{i=n} p_{i} \times x_{i}$
	\item $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{i=n} p_{1} \times x_{i}^2$
\end{itemize}






\begin{itemize}
	\item The Coefficient of Variation is a useful statistic for comparing the \textbf{dispersion} from multiple sample datasets, particularly when the sample means are quite different from each other.
	\item
	When comparing variance in two samples, the sample with the higher coefficient of variation is the sample with higher relative variability.
\end{itemize}

The Coefficient of Variation is the sample standard deviation ($s$) divided by the sample mean ($\bar{x}$), expressed as a percentage.

\[ \mbox{CV}  = \frac{s}{\bar{x}}  \times 100 \% \]

\section{Continuous Joint Probability Distribution}
Continuous Joint Probability Distributions arise from groups of continuous random variables.
Continuous joint probability distributions are characterized by the Joint Density Function, which is similar to that of a single variable case, except that this is in two dimensions.
The joint density function $f(x,y)$ is characterized by the following:

\subsection*{Section 3 : Probability}

How to Compute Probability: Equally Likely Outcomes
Sometimes, a statistical experiment can have n possible outcomes, each of which is equally likely. Suppose a subset of r outcomes are classified as "successful" outcomes.

The probability that the experiment results in a successful outcome (S) is:

P(S) = ( Number of successful outcomes ) / ( Total number of equally likely outcomes ) = r / n

Consider the following experiment. An urn has 10 marbles. Two marbles are red, three are green, and five are blue. If an experimenter randomly selects 1 marble from the urn, what is the probability that it will be green?

In this experiment, there are 10 equally likely outcomes, three of which are green marbles. Therefore, the probability of choosing a green marble is 3/10 or 0.30.

part 3 :  Continuous Probability distributions



\begin{enumerate}
\item Normal distribution
\item Uniform distribution
\item Exponential distribution
\end{itemize}

Additionally, every normal curve (regardless of its mean or standard deviation) conforms to the following "rule".

\begin{enumerate}
\item About $68\%$ of the area under the curve falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean.
\item About $95\%$ of the area under the curve falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean.
\item About $99.7\%$ of the area under the curve falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean.
\end{itemize}

Collectively, these points are known as the empirical rule or the 68-95-99.7 rule. Clearly, given a normal distribution, most outcomes will be within 3 standard deviations of the mean.
