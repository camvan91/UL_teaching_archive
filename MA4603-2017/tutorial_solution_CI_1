\section{Confidence Intervals: Example}

\begin{itemize}
\item The length of life of a type of battery is estimated from a sample of 100 test items taken from a large population. 
\item Sample results show that the mean length of life is 57.4 hours with a standard deviation of 15.1 hours. \\ \bigskip
\item  Construct a 
95\% confidence interval for the mean length of life of all of these batteries.
\end{itemize}






With a sample standard deviation of 15.1 and a sample size of 100, the standard error is as follows:


\[ S.E. (\bar{x}) = \frac{15.1}{\sqrt{100}} \]



With a sample standard deviation of 15.1 and a sample size of 100, the standard error is as follows:


\[ 57.4 \pm \left( 1.96 \times 1.51 \right) \]
