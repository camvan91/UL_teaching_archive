\section{Confidence Interval For The Mean} 
% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS FOR THE MEAN\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose that you wish to estimate the mean sales amount perretail outlet for a particular consumer product during the past year. The number of retail outlets is large. Determine the 95 percent confidence interval given that the sales amounts are assumed to be normally distributed, $\bar{X} = $3,425, s = $200$ ,
and $n = 25.$\\ Ans. $3;346:60 to $3;503:40
\\

%%-8.24. Referring to Problem 8.23, 
\item 
Determine the 95 percent confidence interval given that the population is assumed to benormally distributed, $\bar{X} = $3,425, s = $200$ , and $n = 25.$
\\Ans. $3;342:44 to $3;507:56
\end{enumerate}
