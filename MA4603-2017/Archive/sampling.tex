Sampling
Census and sample survey design. Target and study populations, uses and limitations of non-probability sampling methods, sampling frames, sampling fraction.
Revision and extension of basic concepts from Higher Certificate.
Simple random sampling. Estimators of totals, means and proportions; bias. Estimated standard errors, confidence intervals and precision. Sampling fraction and finite population correction. Ratio and regression estimators.
Examples of practical use in various contexts.
Use of supplementary information.
Stratified random sampling. Estimators of totals, means and proportions; bias. Estimated standard errors, confidence intervals and precision. Cost functions. Proportional and optimal allocations. Limitations of stratified sampling.
Examples of practical use in various contexts.
Minimisation of cost × variance.
One-stage cluster sampling. Estimators for totals, means and proportions with equal cluster sizes and with different cluster sizes. Estimated standard errors, confidence intervals and precision. Link with systematic sampling. Description of two-stage sampling and of multi-stage sampling. Limitations.
Examples of practical use in various contexts.
