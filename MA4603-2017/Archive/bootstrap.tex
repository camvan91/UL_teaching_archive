\subsection{Bootstrap Methods}
If we would repeat our experiment of collecting 50 samples of nitrate concentrations many times we would see the range of error. But it would be a waste of resources and not a viable method.\\
Instead we re-sample `new' data from our data and use so obtained new samples for assessment of the error.
The following \texttt{R} code does the job.
\begin{center}
	\line(1,0){250}
\end{center}
\begin{verbatim}
#Getting data in a vector
m=mean(x)
bootstrap=vector('numeric',500)
for(i in 1:500)
{
bootstrap[i]=mean(sample(x,replace=T))-mean(x)
}
#The distribution of estimation error
hist(bootstrap)
\end{verbatim}
\begin{center}
	\line(1,0){250}
\end{center}
The conclusion of this procedure is that the nitrate concentration is $4999 \pm 0.005$. We are specifically interested in how \texttt{R} was easily able to implement a solution for this.
