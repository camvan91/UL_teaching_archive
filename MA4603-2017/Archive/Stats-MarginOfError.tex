			\textbf{Margin of Error}
			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The product of the quantile and the standard error give us the width of the confidence interval
				\item The width of the confidence interval is known as the \textbf{\emph{margin of error}}.  \[ \mbox{Margin of Error}  = \left[ \mbox{Quantile} \times \mbox{Standard Error} \right] \]
				\item The margin of error gives us some idea about how uncertain we are about the unknown population parameter. \item A very wide interval may indicate that more data should be collected before anything very definite can be said about the parameter.
				\item The only way to control the margin of error is to adjust the sample size accordingly.
				\item By choosing an appropriate sample size, it is possible to ensure that the margin of error does not excess a certain threshold.
