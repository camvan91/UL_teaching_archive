\subsection*{Question 11. (20 marks) }

The frequency of 0 as an input to a binary channel is 0.6. If O is the
input, then 0 is the output with probability 0.8. If l is the input, then l
is the output with probability 0.9.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[a.](4 marks) Calculate the information per bit contained in the input.
	\item[b.](2 marks)Calculate the probability that the output is 0.
	\item[c.](2 marks) Calculate the probability that the output is l,
	\item[d.](2 marks) Calculate the probability that the input is 0 given that the
	output is O.
	\item[e.](2 marks) Calculate the probability that the input is l given that
	the output is 1,
	\item[f.](2 marks) Calculate the probability that the input is l given that
	the output is O.
	\item[g.](2 marks) Calculate the probability that the input is 0 given that
	the output is l.
	\item[h.](6 marks) Calculate the amount of information transmitted by the channel.
	\item[i.](3 marks) Derive the globally optimal reconstruction rule.

Q3
The data from Question 1 (reproduced below) should be used to answer the following question.

Ireland	Texas
1	3.8	3.7
2	3.9	3.8
3	4.0	3.6
4	3.7	3.3
5	3.6	3.4
6	4.1	3.5
7	3.9	3.6
8	4.0	3.7
9	4.1	3.4



Ireland	Texas
Sample Mean	3.90	3.56
Standard Deviation	0.173	x

(a)	Fill in the missing section from the above table			(2 marks)
(b)	Does the data provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that the populations are of equal variances?  Use a 5% level of significance and indicate clearly all calculations made. 					(9 marks)
(c)	You are required to test the hypothesis that there is no statistical difference between the number of units produced at each plant.  Use a test with a 5% probability of a Type 1 error.					(9 marks)
