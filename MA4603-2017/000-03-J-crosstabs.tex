\noindent \textbf{Joint probability tables}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A joint probability table is a table in which all possible events (or outcomes) for one variable are listed as
	row headings, all possible events for a second variable are listed as column headings, and the value entered in
	each cell of the table is the probability of each joint occurrence. 
	
	\item Often, the probabilities in such a table are based
	on observed frequencies of occurrence for the various joint events. 
	\item The table
	of joint-occurrence frequencies which can serve as the basis for constructing a joint probability table is called a
	contingency table.
\end{itemize}
