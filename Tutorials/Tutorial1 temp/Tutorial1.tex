\subsection*{Question 1}

A manager wants to estimate the proportion of faulty resistors produced (in a particular week). Individual units are selected at random times during the morning shift of each day and then tested for faults. In total 1520 resistors were tested and 18 if these were found to be faulty.\\

\subsection*{Question 2}
ITD wish to determine the duration of time that a UL student spends on Facebook each day. They send an email of enquiry to 500 students (by randomly selecting ID numbers) - 286 students respond. The mean time spent on Facebook in this sample was found to be 1.5 hours per day.\\
